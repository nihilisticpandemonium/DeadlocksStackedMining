Version: 0.1.4
Date: 3.08.2020
  Features:
    - A stacked version of ores from mods is created even if no add-on is installed that adds support for these ores
  Changes:
    - Revised major portions of the code responsible for creating the stacked version of ores
    - ? Added a check to verify if the user has admin rights before converting the patches (to-do, suggested by billbo99)
    - Moved the stacked ore generation to "data-updates.lua" to make sure that it runs after other mods have declared new resources
    - Now a stacked version for EVERY ores is created, not just those on a whitelist
    - Replaced entity.minable.result with entity.minable.results instead, to account for some modded ores that might have more than 1 mining result
    - Added localised strings with parameters to use for the names of the stacked ores, instead of a list of all ores that has to be extended for each mod
    - Replaced the function that checks if an entity is a valid stacked-ore / ore in control.lua with a new function that don't rely on a list
    - Removed the whitelist of valid ores in control.lua, because if it no longer needed
    - Increased the amount of fluid an electric miner can hold, because to start a mining operation the fluid capacity of a miner has to be the same/bigger than the amount of fluid required to complete 10 mining operations
        - todo: The fluid capacity of a vanilla miner was only 200, making mining impossible with a stack size setting higher than 20 for uranium ore
        - todo: Added a function that checks if miners added by mods have a high enough fluid capacity for the selected stack size settings
        - todo: If not, then their fluid capacity is overwritten and set to a high enough value (capacity >= amount of fluid needed for 2 mining operations 
    - Moved code that checks if a stacked version of the ore item exists and that in case it does not, create it, into a separate function
        - Now uses the names of the mining results as an argument and not the name of the ore, in case the mining result is something completly different from the ore (eg. Gemstones from Bobs)
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed the bug that in case of high stack size settings the fluid capacity of a miner was not high enough to start a mining operation as mentioned above
    - Fixed that fluid_amount was not adjusted correctly for ores that require fluids to mine, like "uranium ore (marked for stacked mining)"
       - Now the correct amount of fluid is used up when an ore is mined, taking into acount the increased stack size of the ore that are marked for stacked mining
    - Fixed the bug that in case of the gemstones resource from Bobs a stacked version of the item named gem-ore was created, instead of the mining results of the gemstones resource 
  To-do:
    - Support for the mod Pressurized fluids (High-pressurized oil etc.)
    - Support for new modded resource categories, e.g. Imersite from Krastorio 2 (this mod currently only supports resources of the category "basic-solid")
    - Support for Deadlock's Crating Machine as an alternative to Deadlock's Stacking Beltboxes & Compact Loaders
